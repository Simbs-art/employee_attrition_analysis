# Employee_Attrition_Analysis
Data science project exploring patterns in employee attrition using SQL and Python
This repository contains a complete data analysis project focused on understanding the patterns and drivers behind employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to answer 10 critical business questions using both SQL and Python. These questions explored key factors such as job satisfaction, department, age, overtime, income, and work-life balance to determine their impact on employee attrition.

## Key Questions Explored
1. Is there a difference in attrition between departments?   # To spot which departments lose more staff
2. Do employees who work overtime leave more often?   # To understand if overtime is a retention issue
3. How does job satisfaction relate to attrition?   # To identify if dissatisfied employees are quitting
4. Is there a pattern between years at company and attrition?   # To identify exactly when people tend to leave
5. Do younger employees leave more often than older ones?   # To see if retention strategies can be tailored by age group
6. Is there a relationship between income and attrition?   # Exploring if pay impacts quitting decisions
7. Which job roles have the highest attrition rates?   # Target roles for HR support or policy change
8. Do people with more job involvement tend to stay?   # To determine if involvement affects retention
9. How does work-life balance affect attrition?   # To assess if better balance equals less attrition
10. Are employees who have worked at more companies more likely to leave?   # To determine risk based on job history

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)**
- **SQL (SQLite)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Excel (for initial data cleanup)**

## Visualizations
- Bar charts for categorical analysis
- Line plots for trend evolution
- Heatmaps for correlation insights
- Chi-square tests for statistical significance

## Project Structure
- Data - IBM_HR_Analytics.xlsx  # Raw and processed data files (e.g. .csv, .xlsx)
- Notebooks - AttritionProject.ipynb   # Jupyter Notebooks for exploration and visualization
- Sql_queries - Solution.sql  # SQL scripts used for data querying and analysis
- Presentation - Employee_Attrition_Simbiat.pdf    # Final presentation slides
- README.md     # Project overview and documentation

## Findings Summary
- Departments like Sales and R&D show different attrition levels.
- Overtime has a statistically significant impact on attrition (p < 0.00001).
- Lower job satisfaction and poor work-life balance correlate with higher attrition.
- Younger and lower-paid employees are more likely to leave.

## Recommendations
- Improve work-life balance programs.
- Target retention efforts on high-attrition job roles.
- Review compensation structure for junior employees.
- Introduce career development plans for employees in their early years.
